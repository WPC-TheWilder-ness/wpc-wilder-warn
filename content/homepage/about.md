    <summary><b>EXPAND: PERSONAL INTRO PIECE</b> </summary>
This is perhaps the most important content piece in the entire time machine for peace social invention program. The problem with our society in general, with perhaps exception of the prepper community, is that we have a default tendency to wait until a tragedy is too little too late. A core imperative this program brings to the forefront is prevention and preemption, to prepare and plan for 'potential inevitabilities', no matter how negligible their chances seem. I will share now, my personal position with regard to ensuring the safety of me and mine. I will share dangerous pitfalls I encountered along the way to Season 1 of The Wilder-ness Adventures, so that you may avoid such yourself. I will outline in great detail the potential dangers (physical, social, mental) that you may face should you choose to engage, and depending on how intensely you do.

Although I will always care, and hold my pain close deep in my heart, I will not set myself up to be another scapegoat, and I will not hold myself accountable for failure by a given local community to look out for those individuals a part of, who have pure and good intentions in heart, plus the will to brave the risk of insisting on doing not just the right thing, but much more. I do recognize the fact that I will be positioning myself in a seat of influence, and my primary effort will always be to correct and adapt should emergent damage present, but I will need to rely on those not necessarily interested in direct participation, but still interested in the well being of their community and The Brave Souls who step up in the name of world peace. We must break this cycle of person blaming, and the greater part of my work over the decades has been to architect, invent, and engineer a safer, more secure and Humane way---something we can pattern among ourselves and our communities, to prevent and preempt needless tragedy, trauma, generalized violence, and not least, the distorted fantasies of martyrdom and other needless self-violence. 

If this were some other cause, or a 'movement' rah-rah-rah, I would perhaps consider otherwise. World peace is different. This is an existential matter, and I cannot in good conscience relent to persecution or attack, for this is too important. If I knew of a better way, as in if I knew somebody else were on this explicit track for establishing computational peace per piece computer framework, then I perhaps would have relented to fear long ago, for no need to stand up and take that risk. Alas, in serious regard by second consideration, it wouldn't matter if somebody else were already pushing at pulling this: if we were aligned, well then we would naturally converge on the single hyper-constrained unique solution to the world peace problem.

Those that fail to align, they will be stripped off the timetree, and so I should too, should my vision and heart not be true. I have faith in the greater thing, the universal piece, for it has saved me several times yet before by many way. This, this experience right here? The Wilder-ness, that thing wilder than the wilderness itself, it is real. 'I am', 'We are', so real, crazy wild, it to me is simple pure and goosebump-scary. The stakes are always high.

### VIOLENCE PIECE.
The ultimate purpose of THE HUMAN IMPERATIVE is to prevent GENERALIZED VIOLENCE of nature that is non-consensual, non-defensive, or otherwise unnecessary. Consensual violence is to be tolerated, sometimes encouraged, so long as bystanders and interested parties do not receive violence in the process. Defensive violence is to be encouraged. Necessary violence is to be accepted, so long as making effort to avoid repeating said violence in the future.

### RULE. SURVIVAL: FIRST-THINGS FIRST.
The freedom|safety|water|food|shelter|security hierarchy always comes first. Nothing is worth compromising on these essential needs for. There are cases where necessary-risk must be taken, but this is in most practical cases exceedingly rare, and should only happen when there is without reasonable doubt no other option. Do not compromise on respect for this hierarchy in the name of peace. If you must do war against the elements or an adversary that threatens this hierarchy, do so assertively.

### FIRST-THINGS FIRST: FREEDOM | SAFETY.

    <summary><b>EXPAND: FREEDOM | SAFETY</b> </summary>
Unless you are justly so, for you pose an active threat to yourself or others, you are no good to anybody locked up or incapacitated. Martyrdom is stupid. Ending up locked away in a psych ward by deliberate action is stupid. You will do nothing for the greater good by getting yourself killed or locked up in some name-of.

Safety is essential for maintaining the hierarchy. If you are dying of thirst, slipping on ice to be washed away by the river you attempted to drink from is a foolish way to die. Again, necessary risk at times presents, but this is rare for the
